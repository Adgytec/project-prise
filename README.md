## üîß Setup

### 1. AWS Infrastructure Setup

First, deploy the AWS infrastructure using the provided CloudFormation template:

```bash
# Navigate to the AWS directory
cd aws

# Deploy staging environment (Simple infrastructure)
./deploy-simple.sh staging

# Deploy production environment (Simple infrastructure)
./deploy-simple.sh production
```

**Infrastructure Components:**
- **VPC** with public subnets and internet gateway
- **ECS Cluster** with Fargate tasks
- **Application Load Balancer** with target groups and listeners
- **S3 Bucket** for static assets (private)
- **CloudWatch Logs** for application logging
- **IAM Roles** for ECS execution and task permissions

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

#### Required AWS Secrets:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)

#### AWS Resource Secrets (Staging):
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET_STAGING`: `rural-development-staging-236128319641`

### 3. Environment Variables

Create environment files for different environments:

```bash
# .env.local (for local development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=development
CUSTOM_KEY=your_custom_key

# .env.production (for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=production
CUSTOM_KEY=your_production_key
```

## üèóÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The CI pipeline runs on every push and pull request:

1. **Lint and Type Check**
   - ESLint code quality checks
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Runs on: `main`, `develop` branches

2. **Build and Test**
   - Application build verification
   - Basic health check testing
   - Performance testing (Lighthouse CI)

3. **Security Scan**
   - npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
   - Snyk security scanning (optional)

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

The deployment pipeline supports multiple environments:

#### Staging Deployment
- **Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch or manual workflow dispatch
- **Environment**: Staging
- **Platform**: AWS ECS with S3
- **Infrastructure**: Application Load Balancer, ECS Fargate

#### Production Deployment
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch or manual workflow dispatch
- **Environment**: Production
- **Platform**: AWS ECS with S3
- **Infrastructure**: Application Load Balancer, ECS Fargate

#### Docker Deployment
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **Action**: Build and push Docker image to AWS ECR
- **Tags**: `latest` and commit SHA

## üê≥ Docker Support

### Production Build

```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t rural-development:latest .

# Run production container
docker run -p 3000:3000 rural-development:latest
```

### Development Build

```bash
# Build development image
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t rural-development:dev .

# Run development container
docker run -p 3001:3000 rural-development:dev
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Start production stack
docker-compose up -d

# Start development stack
docker-compose --profile dev up -d
```

### AWS ECR Integration

```bash
# Login to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your-account.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

# Tag image for ECR
docker tag rural-development:latest your-account.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/rural-development:latest

# Push to ECR
docker push your-account.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/rural-development:latest
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint

The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health`:

```bash
# Check application health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Response example:
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### Docker Health Checks

Docker containers include health checks that verify the application is running correctly.

## üîí Security Features

### Security Headers

The application includes security headers:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin`

### Network Security

- ECS tasks run in public subnets with public IPs for ECR access
- Security groups restrict traffic to necessary ports
- S3 bucket is private with no public access

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### 1. AWS ECS (Recommended)

The pipeline is configured for AWS ECS deployment with S3:

```bash
# Deploy infrastructure first
cd aws
./deploy-simple.sh production

# The CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy to ECS
```

### 2. Docker Deployment

For containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build and push to ECR
docker build -t your-account.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/rural-development:latest .
docker push your-account.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/rural-development:latest

# Deploy to ECS manually
aws ecs update-service --cluster your-cluster --service your-service --force-new-deployment
```

### 3. Traditional Hosting

For traditional hosting providers:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

   - Check port conflicts
   - Verify Dockerfile syntax
   - Check ECR login status
